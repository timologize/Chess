#Java Chess Engine implemented from scratch

Inludes simple GUI, working AI minimax algorithm, and completed core engine, except for user-picked promotion pieces.

In progress: Pawn promotion choices, more polished GUI, and FEN file compatibility.

This program was created following the YouTube tutorial series by "Software Architecture and Design." 
The core features are created following the tutorial, with a few variances here and there, created on my own.
However, the vast majority of this code still belongs to amir650 on GitHub.
